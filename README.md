## Alif Semiconductor Software Development Kit (SDK) Overview
Alif Semiconductor SDK provides all the necessary instructions and tools to facilitate development of applications on Ensemble and Balleto processors.

Alif Semiconductor SDK includes:
* Geting started guides and application notes
* Tools for security and product configuration
* Example applications and templates
* Support for multiple tool chains - VSCode, Keil MDK
* Support for multiple compilers - GCC, Arm Clang
* Support for multiple RTOSes - Azure RTOS, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr
* Support for Ensemble Evaluation Kits

## Content Description
This repository is intended to provide a summarry of all the SDK related GitHub projects.

### General guidelines
- Most Ensemble SDK examples are designed to run on the M55 (HE/HP) cores in the Real Time Sub-System (RTSS)
- RTSS example applications are built by default using either HP or HE core. The selected core is a build option and can be changed
- Camera examples do not run on E1/E1C/B1 devices due to different camera interface – only LP-Parallel is supported on E1/E1C/B1.

(1) Any model can be run on any core and the limiting factor is the model’s memory requirements and the used memory configuration. Alif provides a reference memory configuration (scripts/cmake/platforms/ensemble) but users can modify these to match their needs. With Alif reference memory configuration some typical use cases are run as follows:
- Alif KWS: M55 HE
- Alif Image Classification: M55 HP
- Alif Object Detection: M55 HP
- Inference runner: M55 HE or M55 HP

(2) Requires audio output for sound. On Alif boards, only AppKit has audio output. Application runs on DevKit also, but without sound output.

(3) Currently linker configuration is provided to M55 HE only but should be easy to port to work on M55 HP also.

(4) Use the E1C project for M55-HE on B1.
